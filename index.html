                <h3>Boiled Vegetable</h3>
                <p>Think of it more as a side dish or meal component than a protein-rich steak—after all, we’re talking
                    about roasted slabs of some veg, or cauliflower. It is really tasty. If you can, please
                    give it a try.</p>

                <h3>Thai & Corn Soup</h3>
                <p>The trick to this silky-smooth, cream-free soup is toasting the flour for the roux and scraping corn
                    milk from the cob. A dash of cayenne lends heat to this cold soup.</p>

                <p>Chhole bhature is often eaten as a breakfast dish. It can also be street food or a complete meal and
                    may be accompanied with onions, pickled carrots, green chutney or achaar.</p>
